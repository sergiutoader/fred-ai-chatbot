# MCPRuntime — one place to own MCP init/refresh/close across agents

## Why this exists

Agents in Fred consume MCP servers (e.g., OpenSearch ops, KPI, tabular). These
servers are typically protected by bearer tokens issued on demand by the
outbound auth layer. Tokens expire. After idle periods a user's first request
often hits a `401 Unauthorized` while the auth layer is still “cold”. If we let
that bubble up in the middle of a tool call:

- The LLM can emit `tool_calls`, but the tool invocation fails → OpenAI rejects
  the **next** message with `400` (“assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be
  followed by tool messages…”). noisy + confusing.
- Reconnecting MCP sessions mid-reasoning can leave dangling transports unless
  they’re closed carefully.

**MCPRuntime** centralizes all that logic:

- Initializes a `MultiServerMCPClient` and wraps tools in a context-aware
  toolkit (so runtime parameters can be injected).
- Provides a **serialized** `refresh()` that builds a *fresh* client + toolkit
  when we detect auth issues or timeouts.
- Closes the *old* client quietly, preferring `aclose()` and falling back to
  `close()` / `AsyncExitStack.aclose()` to avoid leftover tasks and
  `CancelledError` noise.
- Exposes `get_tools()` so your tool node can always fetch the *current* tools
  after a refresh (avoid stale snapshots).

Pair this with the resilient tool node (which emits fallback `ToolMessage`s on
transient errors) and your agents remain stable and chatty, instead of brittle.

## How agents use it (recipe)

- Build once per agent:
    ```python
    self.mcp_runtime = MCPRuntime(agent_settings, lambda: self.get_runtime_context())
    await self.mcp_runtime.init()
    self.model = self.model.bind_tools(self.mcp_runtime.get_tools())
    ```

- In your graph’s tools node:
    ```python
    tools_node = make_resilient_tools_node(
        get_tools=self.mcp_runtime.get_tools,                    # live accessor
        refresh_cb=lambda: self.mcp_runtime.refresh_and_bind(self.model),
    )
    ```

- On shutdown:
    ```python
    await self.mcp_runtime.aclose()
    ```

**Important**: pass the callable `get_tools` (not a captured list). After
`refresh()`, the tool node will pull the fresh tool set automatically.

## Error model & behavior

- `refresh()` is guarded by an `anyio.Lock` to serialize concurrent refresh
  calls. If a refresh fails to connect, the previous client/tools are kept.
- Closing the old client prefers public APIs (`aclose()`, then `close()`),
  falling back to `exit_stack.aclose()` as a last resort. Any close-time errors
  are logged at `INFO` and swallowed (best-effort cleanup).
- This module intentionally **does not** auto-refresh on a schedule. Instead,
  your tool node decides *when* to refresh (e.g., after a timeout or `401`) and
  calls `refresh_and_bind()`.

## Observability

- `_snapshot()` logs a compact one-line view of client/toolkit identities and
  the tool names. This is invaluable for verifying that a refresh re-bound the
  model to a new toolkit and not using stale tools.

## Gotchas & tips

- Always re-bind the model after a refresh (`refresh_and_bind`). Bound tool
  specs are captured by the LLM client; forgetting to re-bind means the LLM
  may try to call tools that no longer belong to the current client.
- Avoid capturing `self.toolkit.get_tools()` into a local list at graph build
  time; use a callable (`get_tools`) so refreshes take effect on the next tool
  run.
- This runtime assumes MCP auth/header/env injection is handled upstream by
  `get_mcp_client_for_agent()` (see `mcp_utils.py`), which also retries once on
  `401` with a freshly minted token.
